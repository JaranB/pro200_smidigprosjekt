# PRO200 Smidig prosjekt

This was a group project in PRO200 at Westerdals/HÃ¸yskolen Kristiania. The task was to build/create something for Kolonial.no in order to boost their sales.

We decied to build an IoT product. The product we built let the user scan empty groceries before tossing them in the trash can. Ideally the product would be places close to the trash can so the user could scan the product with little effort before tossing it like normally. The scanned products will be added to your Kolonial accounts grocery list. If the user actively uses the product the grocery list would be built up over time and the user would not have to write one.

The intention of the product is to make it easier for the customer to order new groceries once they run out. The device would connect to Kolonial's API so the user could request automatic delivery at a specific time.
